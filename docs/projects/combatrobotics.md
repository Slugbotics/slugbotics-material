# UCSC Combat Robotics  

![Photo of our team members](../assets/images/projects/cr/people%20photo%20wide.png)  


We are **UCSC Combat Robotics**, a student-led subteam of [Slugbotics](../index.md) founded in 2021. We design, build, and fight combat robots in tournaments both on and off campus.  

Our team focuses on **hands-on engineering**: CAD design, machining, wiring, assembly, and testing. No prior experience is neededâ€”just an interest in building and competing.  

---

## What We Build  

- **3-lb beetleweights** (fast, destructive, and highly competitive)  
- **1-lb antweights** (intro builds for new members through our Plant Workshop)  

Robots use standard combat robotics systems:  
- Brushless and brushed motors  
- ESCs (electronic speed controllers)  
- LiPo batteries  
- Radio receivers & transmitters (no programming required)  
- Armor, weapon systems, and frames designed and manufactured by students  

---

## What We Do  

- **Build robots** from scratch each year  
- **Run workshops** to teach CAD, machining, soldering, and wiring  
- **Travel to competitions** across California
