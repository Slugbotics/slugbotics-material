# Railspeeder

The Railspeeder project aims to evaluate the condition and saftey of closed and
abandoned rail lines so that reports can be generated and provided to transit
agencies in hopes of reconditioning and reopening these lines. Through this we
aim to expand area and non-local transit options and make travel more affordable
for all.

More information on the Railspeeder project can be found at our documention
site.
