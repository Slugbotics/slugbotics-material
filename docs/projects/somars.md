# Somars

The SOMARS team is currently focused on developing a drone and the supporting
operational capabilities needed to deploy it into wildfires across remote parts
of Santa Cruz. The drone is designed to operate autonomously, navigating
hazardous environments where traditional monitoring methods are difficult or
unsafe.

This system enables real-time tracking of wildfire spread and positioning,
providing live updates to key personnel. By delivering critical situational
awareness, it supports faster and more effective decision-making during wildfire
emergencies.
