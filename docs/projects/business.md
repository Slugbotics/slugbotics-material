Students also have the opportunity to gain experience with financial literacy
and public relations via our <i><strong>business team</strong></i>. Within the
Business Team, there are two main efforts:

1. The Finance Effort focuses on

       - securing sponsorships and building lasting partnerships
       - strategically allocating budgets across all projects
       - And developing long-term financial sustainability for the club.

2. The Outreach Effort focuses on

       - showcasing our work through social media
       - building strong connections with students, faculty, and the greater
         community
       - and organizing events and exhibitions that highlight the innovation
         happening within Slugbotics.
