# Cruz Control
We are **Cruz Control**, the autonomous vehicle subteam of [Slugbotics](../index.md). While we previously competed in the F1TENTH autonomous racing competition, we've evolved into a research-oriented team focused on bridging the gap between simulation and real-world autonomous driving.

Our mission is to develop safe, reliable autonomous vehicle systems that can operate in both controlled environments and real-world conditions. We combine cutting-edge control algorithms with machine learning to create systems that can handle the complexity of real-world driving scenarios.

## What We Build

- **Autonomous vehicle platforms** with state-of-the-art control systems
- **Safe machine learning models** for autonomous decision-making
- **Simulation-to-reality transfer systems** for real-world deployment

Our systems use advanced robotics and autonomous vehicle technologies:
- Computer vision and sensor fusion
- Model Predictive Control (MPC) and other advanced control algorithms
- Machine learning frameworks for safe autonomous driving
- Real-time control systems and embedded software

## What We Do

- **Research autonomous control algorithms** for vehicle navigation
- **Develop safe machine learning models** in collaboration with UCSC's AIEA Lab
- **Bridge simulation and reality** by transferring algorithms from scale models to full-sized vehicles
- **Test and validate** autonomous systems in controlled environments
- **Collaborate with faculty** on cutting-edge autonomous vehicle research

## Our Research Focus

### Hardware & Embedded Systems
We work on both manual control systems (Xbox controller integration) and fully autonomous control using state-of-the-art algorithms. Our platform serves as a testbed for developing and validating control strategies that can be scaled to real-world applications.

### Software & Machine Learning
In collaboration with Professor Leilani Gilpin's AIEA Lab, we're developing safe machine learning models for autonomous vehicle control. Our research focuses on creating systems that can reliably control full-sized vehicles while maintaining safety standards.

### Simulation-to-Reality Transfer
Our ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between autonomous systems that work "in simulation" (like our scale model vehicles) and real vehicles that operate on actual roads. This involves developing robust algorithms that can handle the uncertainties and complexities of real-world environments.
