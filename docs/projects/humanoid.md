# Humanoid

The Humanoid Robot sub team is focused on making a bio-mimetic humanoid robot
entirely in house. We specifically focus on designing our parts to be modular,
easy to repair, and relatively inexpensive, with a goal to make someday make
such robots available to the general public for cheap.

Within our sub team, we have groups that focus on the mechanical design,
programming, and electrical systems that make the robot run, so there's a place
for everyone. Whether you're an engineer, an artist, or just a big fan of cool
robots, feel free to swing by and check us out!
