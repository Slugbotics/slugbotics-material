# UCSC Arm Team

![Photo from our intro meeting](../assets/images/projects/armteam/Armteam%202024%20into%20meeting.jpg)

We are **UCSC Arm Team**, a student-led subteam of [Slugbotics](../index.md)
founded in 2024.

We are building an all-purpose robotic arm that combines **computer vision**,
**task planning**, and **natural language interaction**.

Our project already includes a 3D-printed working arm and vision tracking
software, so the system can recognize objects and their locations in real time.
We are now extending these capabilities with LLM integration, so the arm can
follow natural language commands such as _‚Äúpick up the blue water bottle.‚Äù_ The
arm can also stream on **Twitch** and respond to Twitch chat, letting people
interact with it remotely in a fun and accessible way.

## What We Build

- **3D-printed robotic arm** with modular joints
- **Vision tracking system** for real-time object detection and localization
- **LLM integration** for natural language control
- **Twitch integration** for streaming and interactive chat control

Robots use standard robotic systems:

- Stepper and servo motors
- Computer vision pipelines
- Modular grippers and kinematics

## What We Do

- **Design and build** robotic arms with CAD and 3D printing
- **Develop software** for computer vision and natural language processing
- **Run workshops** on VS Code, CAD, and robotic assembly
- **Collaborate with professors** to explore lab automation
- **Experiment with real-world applications** in farming and lab environments.

## How to Join

1. **Come talk to us on our discord**
2. **Attend a meeting** to get hands-on with CAD, coding, or hardware assembly
3. **Pick a subteam** (vision, control software, or hardware design)
4. **Help us test and expand** the robotic arm‚Äôs features

We especially welcome **chemistry and biomedical students** who want to explore
practical lab automation with us.
