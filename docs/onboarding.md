# Onboarding

**So, you want to join Slugbotics**

You're in the right place! A good fist step is joining our
[Discord](https://discord.slugbotics.com), there you can explore our various
subteams and get to know other members. From there, to start attending meetings
you'll need to complete the BE49 Club Hub module on the
[Slugworks Canvas](https://canvas.ucsc.edu/courses/77701) (this gets refreshed
every year, so don't start it during the summer!). After that, you're off to the
races! Watch out on Discord for meeting announcements, or just come hang out
around the lab and see what people are working on!
