# About

UCSC Slugbotics is a hands on robotics team where students of all majors can take
a step into real world engineering, creativity, and teamwork. Members design and
build competitive robots that compete in national competitions, gaining valuable
skills in mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. No prior experience
is required, and students of all majors are welcomed. We strive to foster an
inclusive and friendly environment for members new and old to get involved in the
world of engineering. Whether you have a project you'd like to start or want to
join a preexisting project team, Slugbotics looks forward to meeting you.
