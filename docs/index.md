## About Us

Slugbotics is a student organization at UC Santa Cruz focused on introducing
students to hands-on robotics engineering.

---

## What We Do

### [MATE Underwater Robotics](projects/mate)

The Mate project enables students to work on Marine Robotics. This project
participates in the MATE ROV International Competition.

### [SOMARS UAV Research](projects/somars)

The SOMARS (System for the Oversight and Management of Autonomous Robotics
Systems) deals with all aspects of aerospace and aviation research and robotics.

### [Combat Robotics](projects/combatrobotics)

The Combat Robotics Team at UCSC creates a safe and engaging space for engineers
to make some cool fighting bots. Our team holds a yearly PLAnt workshop, where
new members work in groups to make 1lb plastic combat robots that compete
against each other. Additionally, our team has 2 beetleweight combat robots that
compete around California.

### [Railspeeder Rail Health Inspection](projects/railspeeder)

The Railspeeder project aims to evaluate the condition and safety of closed and
abandoned rail lines so that reports can be generated and provided to transit
agencies in hopes of reconditioning and reopening these lines.

### [Arm Team](projects/armteam)

We are building a 3D-printed robotic arm with computer vision and natural
language control. It can recognize objects, follow commands like “pick up the
blue water bottle,” and even stream on Twitch to respond to chat. Our goal is to
collaborate with professors and students—especially in chemistry and biomedical
fields—to explore real lab automation and new applications.

### [Humanoid Team](projects/humanoid)

The Humanoid Robot sub team is dedicated to designing and building an in-house
robot that moves like a real person!
