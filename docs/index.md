# Welcome to Slugbotics

Hands-On Robotics at UC Santa Cruz

---

## About Us

Slugbotics is a student organization at UC Santa Cruz focused on introducing
students to hands-on robotics engineering.

### [Combat Robotics](projects/combatrobotics)

The Combat Robotics Team at UCSC creates a safe and engaging space for engineers
to make some cool fighting bots. Our team holds a yearly PLAnt workshop, where
new members work in groups to make 1lb plastic combat robots that compete
against each other. Additionally, our team has 2 beetleweight combat robots that
compete around California.

### [Railspeeder Rail Health Inspection](projects/railspeeder)

The Railspeeder project aims to evaluate the condition and saftey of closed and
abandoned rail lines so that reports can be generated and provided to transit
agencies in hopes of reconditioning and reopening these lines.
