## About Us

Slugbotics is a student organization at UC Santa Cruz focused on introducing
students to hands-on robotics engineering.

---

## What We Do

### [MATE Underwater Robotics](projects/mate)

The Mate project enables students to work on Marine Robotics. This project
participates in the MATE ROV International Competition.

### [Cruz Control Autonomous Vehicles](projects/cruzcontrol)

### [SOMARS UAV Research](projects/somars)

The SOMARS (System for the Oversight and Management of Autonomous Robotics
Systems) deals with all aspects of aerospace and aviation research and robotics.

### [Combat Robotics](projects/combatrobotics)

The Combat Robotics Team at UCSC creates a safe and engaging space for engineers
to make some cool fighting bots. Our team holds a yearly PLAnt workshop, where
new members work in groups to make 1lb plastic combat robots that compete
against each other. Additionally, our team has 2 beetleweight combat robots that
compete around California.

### [Railspeeder Rail Health Inspection](projects/railspeeder)

The Railspeeder project aims to evaluate the condition and saftey of closed and
abandoned rail lines so that reports can be generated and provided to transit
agencies in hopes of reconditioning and reopening these lines.

### [Arm Team](projects/arm)

### [Humanoid Team](projects/humanoid)

The Humanoid Robot sub team is dedicated to designing and building an in-house
robot that moves like a real person!
