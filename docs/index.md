## About Us

Slugbotics is a student led organization at UC Santa Cruz focused on introducing
students to hands-on robotics engineering. Engineers of all skill level are welcome and encouraged to join!

---

## What We Do

### [MATE Underwater Robotics](projects/mate.md)

The Mate project enables students to work on Marine Robotics. This project
participates in the MATE ROV International Competition.

### [Rover Team](projects/rover.md)

The Slugbotics Rover Team operates as one organization with two competition branches: the **University Rover Challenge (URC)** and **NASA Lunabotics Challenge**. Together, we design, build, and test advanced robotic systems for planetary exploration and resource excavation.

#### [University Rover Challenge (URC)](projects/rover.md)

The URC branch builds a Mars rover for the University Rover Challenge, emphasizing autonomy, mechanical innovation, and science payload development.

#### [NASA Lunabotics Challenge](projects/rover.md)

The Lunabotics branch designs a lunar excavation rover that competes in NASA's Lunabotics Challenge, focusing on regolith collection, autonomy, and reliability in hard lunar conditions. 



### [Cruz Control Autonomous Vehicles](projects/cruzcontrol.md)

### [SOMARS UAV Research](projects/somars.md)

The SOMARS (System for the Oversight and Management of Autonomous Robotics
Systems) deals with all aspects of aerospace and aviation research and robotics.

### [Combat Robotics](projects/combatrobotics.md)

The Combat Robotics Team at UCSC creates a safe and engaging space for engineers
to make some cool fighting bots. Our team holds a yearly PLAnt workshop, where
new members work in groups to make 1lb plastic combat robots that compete
against each other. Additionally, our team has 2 beetleweight combat robots that
compete around California.

### [Railspeeder Rail Health Inspection](projects/railspeeder.md)

The Railspeeder project aims to evaluate the condition and safety of closed and
abandoned rail lines so that reports can be generated and provided to transit
agencies in hopes of reconditioning and reopening these lines.

### [Humanoid Team](projects/humanoid.md)

The Humanoid Robot sub team is dedicated to designing and building an in-house
robot that moves like a real person!
